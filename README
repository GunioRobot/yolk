--  Introduction --
-------------------

Yolk is an Ada based web-toolbox that sits on top of AWS[1], GNATcoll[2], 
Florist[3], XML/Ada[4] and PostgreSQL[5].

It is important to understand that Yolk itself does very little that cannot be
accomplished using plain AWS, GNATcoll, XML/Ada and Florist. It is, for lack of
a better term, a convenience. Some of things that Yolk offers are:

    * Sending emails from the application
    * Setting up rotating log files and handling basic log file management
    * Loading configuration files
    * Handling the most common static content types (HTML, PNG, ICO and so on)
    * Easy Atom RSS feed generation
    * Connecting to one or more PostgreSQL databases
    * Switching to an un-privileged user.
    * Start/stop as a "regular" daemon using an rc script.

Be sure to check out the Yolk demo application for a good example on how to make
use of Yolk.

I've only ever tested Yolk on Linux. I've no idea if it works on Windows or Mac,
and I've no current plans for trying my hand at those two platforms. If you'd
like to help make it work for Mac and/or Windows, feel free to contact me at

--  Dependencies  --
--------------------

Yolk depends on 6 things out of the box. All of these are required:

    1. An Ada 2005 compiler[6]
    2. AWS (required version >= 2.10.0)
    3. GNATcoll (required version >= 1.4)
    4. Florist (required version >= florist-gpl-2011)
    5. XML/Ada (required version >= 4.1)
    6. PostgreSQL (compile GNATcoll with PostgreSQL support)

Yolk might work with other versions of the above software, but those are the
versions I've tested it with.

The path to the AWS, GNATcoll, Florist and XML/Ada project files must be added
to the ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable, or else your Yolk project wont
compile.

My usual modus operandi for setting up these 6 things goes something like this:

    1.  Install PostgreSQL by whatever means is fitting for the OS. 

    2.  Install GNAT GPL in its default location (/usr/gnat) and add /usr/gnat/bin
        to your PATH:

            $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/gnat/bin
            $ export PATH

        You might want to add this to .bashrc:

            PATH=$PATH:/usr/gnat/bin
            export PATH

        And this to .bash_profile:

            if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
                . ~/.bashrc;
            fi

        Of course depending on your system. Mine is Slackware. The important
        thing is to make sure /usr/gnat/bin is added to your PATH even after
        a reboot.

        This step is of course only necessary if you don't already have an Ada
        compiler installed.

    3.  Install GNATcoll in /usr/gnat:

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnat \
                                --disable-gtk \
                                --disable-pygtk \
                                --with-python \
                                --with-postgresql

        You should of course adjust the above configuration options to fit your
        needs, just make sure PostgreSQL support is enabled.

            $ make
            $ make install

    4.  Install Florist in /usr/gnat:

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnat
            $ make
            $ make install

    5.  Install XML/Ada in /usr/gnat:

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnat
            $ make all
            $ make docs
            $ make install

    6.  Install AWS in its default location. See makefile.conf for further
        information. After having run

            $ make setup

        be sure to check that makefile.setup contains the correct information.
        It should look something like this, of course depending on how much
        you've enabled in the makefile.conf file:

            prefix=/usr/gnat/bin/..
            DEFAULT_LIBRARY_TYPE=static
            DEFAULT_TARGET=native
            ENABLE_SHARED=true
            ZLIB=true
            XMLADA=true
            ASIS=false
            IPv6=false
            SOCKET=openssl
            LDAP=false
            DEBUG=false
            CJOBS=2
            DEMOS=false
            TARGET=native

        Finally run

            $ make build
            $ make build_doc
            $ make install

    5.  Add /usr/gnat/bin to your PATH environment variable.

    6.  Add /usr/gnat/lib/gnat to your ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.

Don't take the above for gospel. You should _always_ read all the accompanying
documentation for the software you're trying to install.

For reference, I can say that on my Slackware Linux system, I have the AWS,
XML/Ada, Florist and GNATcoll project files available in these directories:

    /usr/gnat/lib/gnat/aws.gpr
    /usr/gnat/lib/gnat/xmlada.gpr
    /usr/gnat/lib/gnat/florist.gpr
    /usr/gnat/lib/gnat/gnatcoll_postgresql.gpr

My ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable hence contains this:

    /usr/gnat/lib/gnat

If your distribution provides pre-made packages for all of this, you should
probably use those instead.

    I personally use the GNAT GPL compiler from AdaCore, but there's a good chance
    the latest GCC Ada compiler will work just fine.
