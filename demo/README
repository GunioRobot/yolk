-------------------
--  Introduction --
-------------------

The Yolk demo application serves two purposes:

    1. It serves as an example on how Yolk can be used in an AWS application.
    2. It contains examples on how all the various Yolk packages can be used.

Obviously Yolk comes with complete documentation and a fair amount of source
code comments, but in some cases it is easier to "get" a system if you see
some actual working code. The Yolk demo application is such working code.

Yolk is GPLv3, see ../COPYING3 and ../COPYING.RUNTIME.

--------------------
--  Dependencies  --
--------------------

The Yolk demo application depends on:

    1. Yolk.
    2. GNATcoll, compiled with PostgreSQL support.

If you managed to build and install Yolk, you will most certainly be able to
build and use the Yolk demo application.

Of course you should also adjust the configuration/ files to match your own
setup, but thats not really a dependency is it?  :o)

------------------------------
--  The database demo page  --
------------------------------

For the database demo page to work, you must set these my_config.ini keys:

    DB_Host
    DB_Name
    DB_Password
    DB_User

And obviously you must have a DB_Name database setup at the DB_Host with
credentials matching those given in DB_User and DB_Password.

You do _not_ need to create any tables in the DB_Name database.

---------------------------
--  The email demo page  --
---------------------------

For the email demo page to work, you must set these my_config.ini keys:

    SMTP_Host
    SMTP_Port

These must point to a reachable and functional SMTP server.

---------------------------------------
--  Using the Yolk demo application  --
---------------------------------------

After having build the Yolk demo application (see INSTALL), trying it out is
a simple matter of:

    Adjust the configuration/ files according to your setup
    $ cd exe/
    $ ./yolk_demo
    Using your browser, visit http://localhost:4242

You can stop the server cleanly pressing CTRL+c. Or simply kill the PID found
in the exe/yolk_demo.pid file.

Instead of starting/stopping the application by calling the yolk_demo executable
directly, you can use the tools/rc.yolk script. Using this will enable you to
run a Yolk application like any other server-software. It is properly detached
from the console. All you have to do is edit a few variables at the beginning of
the script, so it fits your environment.

To see the status page for the application, go to

    http://localhost:4242/status

and enter "admin" as username and "changemenow" as password. See config.ini for
how to change the password for this page. Look for the Admin_Password option.

-------------------------------------------
--  Using the Yolk demo as a foundation  --
-------------------------------------------

You can absolutely use the Yolk demo application as a foundation for your own
applications. Just do this:

    1. You probably want to rename the application from yolk_demo to something
       else. This requires you to:

         A.  Rename the main procedure in yolk_demo.adb.
         B.  Rename the main yolk_demo.adb file.
         C.  Adjust the project file accordingly, renaming the "for Main use" file.

    2. Adjust the My_Handlers package, and create matching view packages.

    3. Adjust the My_Configuration package and the my_config.ini file.

    4. Get rid of all the irrelevant Yolk demo application source code.

    5. Go!
