# String
# Default: static_content/compressed_cache
# Used by AWS: No
#
# The directory where the .gz compressed versions of static content are saved.
# This directory is cleared out on every reboot of the server, meaning that
# _everything_ in this directory is deleted, so be very careful about the path
# you set for this parameter.
#
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist when the server is started.
#
# This parameter only matters if Compress_Static_Content is True.
#
# NOTE:

# Natural
# Default: 86400
# Used by AWS: No
#
# If a resource compressed by the Yolk.Static_Content.Compressable function is

# Used by AWS: Yes
#
# Number of seconds before timing out when receiving data.

# Used by AWS: Yes
#
# Number of seconds before timing out when sending data.

Server_Host
# String
# Default: [no value]

#
# The name of the server.

Server_Port 4242
# Positive
# Default: 4242

# Time in seconds between each removal of obsolete transient pages.

Transient_Lifetime 300.0

# Used by AWS: Yes
#
# Number of seconds to keep session information. After this period a session
# is obsoleted and will be removed at next cleanup.

Activate_SQL_Cache_Log False
# Boolean
# Default: True
# Used by AWS: No
#
# When this is True, all SQL queries generated by GNATcool that involve the cache

# Depending on your application, this can be a very busy stream, so it should  
# probably only be set to True during development/debugging.

Activate_SQL_Error_Log False
# Boolean
# Default: True
# Used by AWS: No
#
# When True, all database related errors (failed transactions, failed connections)
# are sent to syslog. This should probably always be True.

Activate_SQL_Select_Log False
# Boolean
# Default: True
# Used by AWS: No
#
# When True, all GNATcoll SQL SELECT queries are sent to syslog.

#
# The security mode to use for the secure connections. Available options are:
