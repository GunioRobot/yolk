Before trying to compile the Yolk demo application, be sure to read the README
and make sure that all the dependencies are met.

Building the Yolk demo is as simple as:

    $ make
   
And that's all. You now have a fully functioning Yolk application in the exe/
directory. Be sure to adjust the exe/configuration/* config files to match your
setup.
