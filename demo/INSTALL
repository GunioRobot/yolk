Before trying to compile the Yolk demo application, be sure to read the README
and make sure that all the dependencies are met.

Building the Yolk demo is as simple as:

    $ make

And that's all. You now have a fully functioning Yolk application in the exe/
directory. Be sure to adjust the exe/configuration/* config files to match your
setup.

You can build a debug version of the demo with:

    $ make debug

If you have valgrind available on your system, you can try running this version
with:

    $ valgrind -v --leak-check=full \
                  --show-possibly-lost=no \
                  --track-origins=yes yolk_demo

You'll get some leaks, but they are stable and does not grow over time, so
don't worry about them.
