When you clone Yolk from the offical Git repository, it comes setup with a
demo website that will run out of the box.
This makes it easy to check that everything is working as intended at the
cost of a bit of cleaning up before you can get started on your own application.

First order of business is checking that you have all the required dependencies
installed:

    1. AWS
    2. GNATcoll

When you're certain that the dependencies are met, then all you need to do is
follow these 5 steps:

    1. cd /path/to/Yolk
    2. gnatmake -P yolk.gpr
    3. cd exe/
    4. ./yolk
    5. Using your browser, visit http://localhost:4242

You can shutdown the server cleanly by pressing CTRL+c. Or simply kill the PID
found in the yolk.pid file.

Instead of starting/stopping your application by calling the Yolk executable
directly, you can use the tools/rc.yolk script. Using this will enable you to
run a Yolk application like any other server-software. It is properly detached
from the console. All you have to do is edit a few variables at the beginning of
the script, so it fits your environment.

To see the status page for the application, go to http://localhost:4242/status
and enter "admin" as username and "changemenow" as password. Please make sure
that this password is changed before you go public with your application. See
exe/configuration/config.ini for how to do this. Look for the Admin_Password
option.

If the index page (with all the static content tests) are shown correctly and
you can access the status page, then Yolk is ready to be used.

If Yolk isn't working, then it's worth checking that:

    * gnatmake is in your PATH
    * The ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable contains the paths to your AWS
      and GNATcoll project files.
    * If you've installed your Ada compiler to somewhere else than /usr/gnat/bin,
      then make sure that the "for Compiler_Command" option in yolk.gpr is
      adjusted accordingly.
    * That you're not already using port 4242 for something else.

See the README file and the docs/ for more information on how to use Yolk.
