When you clone Yolk from the offical Git repository, it comes setup with a 
demo website that will run out of the box. 
This makes it easy to check that everything is working as intended at the 
cost of a bit of cleaning up before you can get started on your own application.

First order of business is checking that you have all the required dependencies
installed:

    1. AWS
    2. GNATcoll

When you're certain all is well, all you need to do is follow these 5 steps:

    1. cd /path/to/yolk.gpr
    2. gnatmake -P yolk.gpr
    3. cd exe/
    4. ./yolk
    5. Using your browser, visit http://localhost:4242

To see the status page for the application, go to http://localhost:4242/status
and enter "admin" as username and "changemenow" as password. Please make sure 
that this password is changed before you go public with your application. See
exe/aws.ini for how to do this. Look for the Admin_Password option.

You can shutdown the server cleanly by pressing CTRL+c. Or simply kill the PID
found in the yolk.pid file.

If the index page (with all the static content tests) are shown correctly and
you can access the status page, then Yolk is ready to be used.

If Yolk isn't working, then it's worth checking that:

    * gnatmake is in your PATH
    * The ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable contains the paths to your AWS
      and GNATcoll project files.
    * If you've installed your Ada compiler to somewhere else than /usr/gnat/bin, 
      then make sure that the "for Compiler_Command" option in yolk.gpr is 
      adjusted accordingly.
    * That you're not already using port 4242 for something else.
    
See the README file for more information on how to use Yolk.
