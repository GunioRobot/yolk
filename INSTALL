When you download Yolk, it comes setup with a demo website that will run out
of the box. This makes it easy to check that everything is working as intended
at the cost of a bit of cleaning up before you can get started on your own
application.

First order of business is checking that you have all the required dependencies
installed:

    1. AWS
    2. GNATcoll

When you're certain all is well, all you need to do is follow these 6 steps:

    1. cd /path/to/yolk.gpr
    2. tools/start.sh
    3. gnatmake -P yolk.gpr
    4. cd exe/
    5. ./yolk
    6. Using your browser, visit http://localhost:4242

If you see the Yolk demo webpage, all is working. If not, then it's worth
checking that:

    * gnatmake is in your PATH
    * The ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable contains the paths to your AWS
      and GNATcoll project files.

See the README file for more information on how to use Yolk.
