--  Define how much of the GNATCOLL.SQL logging data you want to log.
--  For a production site you probably only want SQL.ERROR turned on.

SQL=no >&rotating_log
--  Default: SQL=no >&rotating_log
--
--  The SQL track logs all the SQL queries that are _not_ SELECT
--  queries, ie. those that actually modify the database. This track is
--  usually very busy, so it should probably only be activated for
--  debugging purposes.
--  Note that connection problems are also registered on this track.
--
--  To enable:
--      SQL=yes >&rotating_log

SQL.SELECT=no >&rotating_log
--  Default: SQL.SELECT=no >&rotating_log
--
--  The SQL.SELECT track logs all SELECT SQL queries. This is usually
--  a very busy track, so it should probably only be activated for
--  debugging purposes.
--
--  To enable:
--      SQL.SELECT=yes >&rotating_log

SQL.ERROR=yes >&rotating_log
--  Default: SQL.ERROR=no >&rotating_log
--
--  All database related errors (failed transactions, failed queries)
--  are logged to the SQL.ERROR track. This track should probably
--  always be activated.
