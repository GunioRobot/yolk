If sessions are enabled for the server, a session file will be created
whenever the server is shutdown and then read again when it is started.

This simple system make it possible for a server to maintain session
state between reboots, which under some circumstances can be quite handy.

Look at the Sessions section of the configuration/config.ini file for
more information.

The following two configuration/config.ini parameters are of special
importance:

    Session_Cleanup_Interval
    Session_Lifetime

Setting these too high could mean wasting a lot of resources if your
server is very busy.
