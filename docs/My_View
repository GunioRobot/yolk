In the my_view/ directory we find the View package and its children. Together
these packages are your application. It is these packages that are called when
a resource is requested.

I've opted for this solution because I like it. It makes sense to me with a
parent package and a bunch of children, each representing a specific resource.

You are of course free to do whatever you want. My method is just one way of
doing things.
