Yolk comes with 5 pre-created my_* directories. These are:

    my_configuration/
    my_core/
    my_database/
    my_handlers/
    my_view/

They serve only one role: Convenience.

The idea is that you place your application specific code in the relevant
directory, ie. database code in my_database and so on.

This is not a convention you _have_ to follow. If you don't want to use these
directories, simply delete them and remove the reference to them in the main
Yolk project file.
