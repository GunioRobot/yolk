Yolk comes with a few templates, all of which can be found in the templates/
directory.

In templates/system/ we find the 404 and the directory listing templates. These
can be moved to another directory by changing the System_Templates_Path value
in configuration/config.ini.

If you intend to make changes to these files, it's probably best to move them
to another directory, to avoid having the overwritten by a Yolk upgrade.

You can read more about the templating system used at this link:
