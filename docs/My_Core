The my_core/ directory is for all intents and purposes a convenience
directory. It serves no other role than that of a container for all
your core application code, ie. if it doesn't fit in the my_view
directory, then it should be placed in my_core.

Obviously you don't have to follow this convention, and getting rid
of my_core is as simple as deleting it and removing the reference to
it in the yolk.gpr file.
