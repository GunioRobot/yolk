Enabling SSL in a Yolk application is a simple matter of:

    1. Having compiled AWS with SSL enabled.
    2. Having a valid certificate.
    3. Alter three settings in aws.ini.
    
The first is simple to solve: Just make sure that you've set the SOCKET
options in the AWS makefile.conf file to "openssl" instead of "std". You must
of course have OpenSSL installed for this to work. Read the AWS manual for
more information.

The second can be solved be either having a valid certificate already, or be
creating a test certificate yourself. In order to create a test certificate,
all you have to do is this:

    1. $ openssl genrsa -rand <filename> -out ca-key.pem
    2. $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
    3. $ cat ca-key.pem ca-cert.pem > aws.pem
    4. $ cp aws.pem /path/to/yolk/exe/certificates

And that's it. Now all you have to do is take a closer look at these three
aws.ini options:

    Certificates
    Security
    Security_Mode

And that is all. Restart your Yolk application, and you should now be able to
access the content using a secure connection.

Note: If you set the Security option to True, your application will no longer
accept connections on regular HTTP.
