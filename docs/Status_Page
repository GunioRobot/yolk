The AWS status page contains most of the AWS configuration settings, and some
interesting runtime facts about your server, such as amount of resources
served.

The configuration for the status page is handled by these config.ini parameters:

    Admin_Password
    Admin_URI
    Status_Page

Especially the first is important to change on a live server. You should _not_
run a live server with the default password.

You cannot disable the status page, but you can make it very inaccessible by
setting both Admin_Password and Admin_URI to something completely insane.
