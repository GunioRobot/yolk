Yolk comes with support for some static content out of the box:

    CSS
    GIF
    HTML
    ICO
    JPG
    JS
    PNG
    SVG
    XML
    XSL

If you need more, you can either add them to the My_Handlers package or the
core Handlers package. The former is the preferred method.

If you look at core Handlers package you'll notice that there are two different
handlers:

    AWS.Services.Dispatchers.URI.Register_Regexp
      (Dispatcher  => RH,
       URI         => Config.Get (Handler_CSS),
       Action      => Create (Callback => SC.Text_File'Access));

    AWS.Services.Dispatchers.URI.Register_Regexp
      (Dispatcher  => RH,
       URI         => Config.Get (Handler_GIF),
       Action      => Create (Callback => SC.Binary_File'Access));

The important distinction between these two are the callback used in Action.
It's either Text_File or Binary_File. In the former case _all_ content is
gzipped if Compress_Static_Content in configuration/config.ini is True. In
the latter case content is never gzipped.

Obviously this means that the Text_File function should never be used for
stuff like PDF files, but only for files that contain actual plain text where
compression makes sense.
