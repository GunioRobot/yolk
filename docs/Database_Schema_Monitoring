One of the really nice things about the GNATColl database interface is its
ability to monitor your database schema via its gnatcoll_db2ada tool.

Using this tool, you can generate Ada packages that reflect your database
schema. These packages can then help you write SQL queries without having to
embed literal SQL strings in your code. Instead you use Ada function calls.
It helps to ensure syntactic validity of the queries, type safety and that
the query only reference fields that actually exist in the database.

An example:

    Q : SQL_Query := SQL_Select
                       (Fields => Table1.Field1 & Table2.Field2,
                        From   => Table1 & Table2,
                        Where  => Table1.Field3 = Table2.Field4);

Which is obviously less error-prone than the SQL string equivalent.

The gnatcoll_db2ada tool is documented in the GNATColl documentation, which
